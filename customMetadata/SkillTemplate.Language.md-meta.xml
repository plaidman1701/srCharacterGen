        <value xsi:type="xsd:string">Players should note that there are no formal troll, dwarf, or ork languages. These characters use the languages of their mothers and fathers, most of whom are human. These groups may often speak a kind of patois, however.City Speak is one of several languages that are not part of any formal language group. Elvish, known more formally as Sperethiel, has been gaining popularity in recent years. Linguists who have studied the language&apos;s form and content can find no direct connections to existing language groups, though apparent derivations exist in Sperethiel&apos;s structure and style. The language apparently first came into use shortly after the founding of Tir Taimgire.As stated above, orks, trolls, dwarfs, and other groups that commonly live together In certain neighborhoods may frequently develop their own informal patois.</value>
