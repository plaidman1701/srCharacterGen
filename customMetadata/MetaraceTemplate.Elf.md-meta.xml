        <value xsi:type="xsd:string">The height of the typical elf is 1.9 meters, and his weight is 72 kilograms. Coloration is pale pink to white or ebony. The females have 2 mammae, and all elves have 32 teeth. Nobilis is more slender than sapiens and has a lighter build, though the bone structure and musculature are equally strong. The slenderness is exaggerated in nobilis of Polynesian and Australian aboriginal origin. Elven body hair is sparse, but head hair is usually luxuriant and extremely fine. Elven hair is usually straight or slightly wavy, and Is almost always worn long. There are also several populations showing tightly curled head hair, however. The eyes are almond-shaped; in darker-skinned nobilis they are often slightly protuberant. The ears come to a definite point.</value>
